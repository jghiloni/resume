\section{SELECTED WORK EXPERIENCE}\vspace{10pt}

\employer{\textbf{Havrion, LLC}}
\title{\textbf{VP of Engineering / Chief Programmer}}
\dates{\textbf{August 2024 – November 2025}}
\location{}
\begin{position}
\textsl{Summary} \\
Havrion is a company in the digital signage space with a simple value proposition:
You've already spent a ton of money on your displays; you shouldn't need to spend
more on hardware to make it do what you want it to do. I served as its first VP of
Engineering, while also contributing significantly to the product and infrastructure
code.

\textsl{Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
  {\item Migrated code and CI/CD pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitHub to take advantage
  of GitHub and GitHub Actions' more advanced tooling}
  {\item Designed new Kubernetes-based architecture to reduce cost over Azure Functions-based
  strategy that was built for a scale that didn't exist and wouldn't for a number of years}
  {\item Brought TDD and Lean Product Management principles to my team of young engineers and
  Product Managers, with varying levels of success}
  {\item Worked to decouple from Samsung's Tizen Ecosystem and refactor into a platform
  agnostic solution}
\end{itemize}

\textsl{Required Skills} \\
Leadership, Mentorship, Backlog Management, Azure, GitHub, Kubernetes, Typescript, Python, Go,
React, Angular, Grafana, Mimir, Loki

\employer{\textbf{Realtor.com}}
\title{\textbf{Principal Software Engineer}}
\dates{\textbf{March 2022 – January 2024}}
\location{}
\begin{position}
\textsl{Summary} \\
Realtor.com is an online real estate platform that provides comprehensive property listings.
I worked as a Principal Software Engineer enhancing product quality and developer enablement.

\textsl{Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
  {\item On loan to another team, I developed a super-low-latency (sub 10-ms) DynamoDB-based system for
  redirecting approximately 30,000 URL patterns from a recent acquisition's legacy platform
  to their new system using RDC infrastructure}
  {\item Implemented New Relic-based synthetic monitoring of approximately 25 critical systems,
  which allowed us to accurately report their rolling 28-day uptime weekly to be shared with
  senior management; it was often the only system that indicated an outage to a team. This data
  was then fed into an Apache Airflow workflow that ended up with the data in Snowflake for long-term
  analytics}
  {\item Developed a plugin-oriented Go-based CLI called \href{https://github.com/gideaworx/terraform-exporter}{\texttt{terraform-exporter}}
  that allowed product teams to own their monitors' definitions by exporting the monitors as \texttt{terraform} IaC}
  {\item Automated generation of quarterly SLO reports intended for SVP+ level executives that previously took
  a senior direct, principal engineer, and principal project manager approximately 100 person-hours to create}
  {\item Converted existing ECS-based Playwright infrastructure used by deprecated Jenkins CI/CD pipelines to
  use Argo Worflows, to be used by CircleCI CI pipelines and ArgoCD Deployments}
\end{itemize}

Mentorship, Observability, Go, Typescript, NestJS, Python, AWS, DynamoDB, CircleCI, ECS, EKS,

\employer{\textbf{Pivotal Software / VMware}}
\title{\textbf{Staff Solutions Architect}}
\dates{\textbf{July 2017 – February 2022}}
\location{}
\begin{position}
\textsl{Summary} \\
Along with my world-class team of client-facing Solutions Architects as
part of VMware Tanzu Labs (formerly Pivotal Labs), I helped my clients transform the way they build
and run software platforms. My job entailed shepherding a team of client
platform engineers, product managers, and designers through their journey
in deploying and effectively using the VMware Tanzu suite and delivering value
to their customers, which are usually in-house development teams. I focused on building
Site Reliability Engineering compentencies, as well fostering automation-first,
security-first architectures.

\textsl{Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
  {\item Taught customers TDD, XP, and Lean Product Management in the context of
  managing an in-house PaaS}
  {\item Developed \href{https://concourse-ci.org}{Concourse CI} pipelines with customers
  to automate patch and upgrade management of products associated with PCF and later Tanzu}
  {\item Taught customers to build and maintain a curated backlog in concert with my Product
  Management counterpart}
  {\item Built a product with a small subteam that allowed customers who were using versions
  of our product that were too old to upgrade to stand up a new instance at the latest version
  and migrate the state of their existing instance to the new instance, including state and
  all workloads}
  {\item Led delivery of a pilot managed service offering; as the customer's in-house SRE team,
  we nearly automated ourselves out of work with automated upgrades and proactive SLO alerting}
\end{itemize}

\employer{\textbf{ECSTeam, Inc., now part of CGI}}
\title{\textbf{Principal Consultant}}
\dates{\textbf{November 2012 - July 2017}}
\location{}
\begin{position}
\textsl{Summary} \\
As a boutique IT consultancy in Denver, CO, I received praise from both customers
and coworkers for the solutions I delivered and my manner dealing with all levels
of technical acumen I encountered

\textsl{Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
{\item Was half of the infrastructure architecture team for Connect for Health Colorado,
Colorado's ACA exchange. Due to design choices we made from a user experience and
infrastructure perspective, C4HCO holds the esteemed honor of being the only exchange
without an outage on October 1, 2013, the day the exchanges went live}
{\item Developed a custom SFTP solution that allowed us to accept EDI files from roughly
35 different insurance providers in a zero-trust manner. When files arrived, we validated
them, and did minimal normalization before passing them to Oracle's Healthcare Adapter for
further processing}
{\item At a client in the space industry, deployed UAA—Cloud Foundry's OAuth2 authorization
server—for service to service communication, along with a simple SDK for creating secured
API endpoints, that was both similar to its counterparts while still being idiomatic Java,
Python, and Ruby}
{\item Was a founding member of ECSTeam's Cloud Native Practice, focusing on partnering with
Pivotal to provide post-sales delivery for the Pivotal team on a subcontracted basis}
