\section{OBJECTIVE}          
    To change the world, of course. I want to help developers find their value line, and provide them solutions and tools to stay above it.

   {\bf Staff Solutions Architect} \> Pivotal Software, Inc. and VMware, Inc. \> July 2017–Present
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-10pt}
    Along with my world-class team of client-facing Solutions Architects as
    part of VMware Tanzu Labs, I'm helping my clients transform the way they build 
    and run software platforms. My job entails shepherding a team of client 
    platform engineers, product managers, and designers through their journey 
    in deploying and effectively using the VMware Tanzu suite and delivering value
    to their customers, which are usually in-house development teams. I focus on building 
    Site Reliability Engineering compentencies, as well fostering automation-first, 
    security-first architectures.

    Since May 2020, I have been leading the delivery of a small in-house SRE team as we pilot
    a new managed service offering for our customers. In this capacity, I have been
    able to take the SRE knowledge that we impart to our customer SRE teams,
    implement it myself, and work to continously improve upon that knowledge
    base. I lead incident post-mortems with our customers, as well as keep them
    up to date on the health and status of their platform.

    {\bf Principal Consultant} \> ECSTeam, Inc., now part of CGI \> November 2012–July 2017
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-10pt}
    As a boutique IT consultancy in Denver, CO, my time with ECSTeam first 
    started as an infrastructure architect for Connect for Health Colorado, 
    the ACA Exchange for the state of Colorado, based on Oracle's middleware suite. 
    
    Later, I became part of a small practice within the company focused on 
    emerging cloud technologies. As we became a Pivotal Ready Partner, I 
    participated in Pivotal Cloud Foundry "dojos" beginning in 2016. In that 
    context, I was involved with many of the same type of engagements that I 
    lead today.

   {\bf Advisory Software Engineer}  \> IBM \> June 2003–November 2012
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-10pt}
    My career at IBM was focused on its content management and collaboration 
    portfolio. I started in QA for the IBM Portal Personalization rules engine. 
    In 2006, I moved into a development role for the same product.

    Later, I led development efforts to integrate IBM's collaboration tools 
    Lotus Quickr and IBM Connections with its Enterprise Content Management 
    portfolio. From there, I moved to IBM SmartCloud, where I focused on 
    multi-tenancy. All development efforts were full-stack, with custom 
    Javascript client-side, J2EE back ends, with occasional dabbling in 
    other technologies (ActiveX, Flash, etc)
